# Crash course on Linear Algebra

I taught this week-long course at Mathcamp 2019 as a proof-based introduction to Linear Algebra.
The prerequisites for this course are basic proof techniques.
The course is designed in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.
The notes are quite terse and are meant to be challenging.
